Each standard underlines that without effective leadership, even the most well-defined processes cannot achieve intended benefits.\n\n• Collaboration, trust-building, and shared accountability are common themes. PRINCE2, ISO 21502, and PMBOK 7 each acknowledge that leadership extends beyond directing tasks—it requires engaging stakeholders, mediating conflicts, and fostering a culture where people feel responsible for outcomes.\n\n• Communication is central to leadership in all three: project leaders must ensure clarity of objectives, transparent reporting, and responsiveness to team concerns.",
